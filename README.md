## What is it?
Want to start prototyping some level designs? do some basic blockouts? 
Don't want to deal with fiddly project setup? 

This project is a basic starting environment that uses packages and free assets 
on the unity asset store. 

It has:

 - Screen Fader
 - Game Manager
 - New Input System Bindings
 - First Person Controller (Kinematic Character Controller)
 - Cinemachine (with some basic wind and post processing)
 - Prototyping Tools (Probuilder with Gridbox Materials)
 - UI Template (4k Photoshop templates for HUD and Menu elements)
 - Configured Defaults (replaces probuilder default material, replaces TMP default font, sets up prefab editing scenes)

 ## About

 There is also an obsidian vault included that I will add additional notes in as I find time to. I'll break down a few of the design decisions as well as 
 include some resources to learn more.
