# 3D-Starter-Project

## What is it?
Want to start prototyping some level designs? do some basic blockouts? 
Don't want to deal with fiddly project setup? 

This project is a basic starting environment that uses packages and free assets 
on the unity asset store.

It has:

 - Screen Fader
 - Game Manager
 - New Input System Bindings
 - First Person Controller (Kinematic Character Controller)
 - Cinemachine (with some basic wind and post processing)
 - Prototyping Tools (Probuilder with Gridbox Materials)
 - UI Template (4k Photoshop templates for HUD and Menu elements)
 - Configured Defaults (replaces probuilder default material, replaces TMP default font, sets up prefab editing scenes)

 ## About

 There is also an obsidian vault included that I will add additional notes in as I find time to. I'll break down a few of the design decisions as well as 
 include some resources to learn more. 

 ## Resources Used

## Additional Notes

The main branch is for the most part going to stay un-opinionated and just act a basic environment to rapid prototype. 
In other branches though I will look at adding some other scripts that peope might find useful but are more specific like
tooling around trigger boxes and common interactions e.g Bi-directional passage ways.

There will also be the odd test scene with things people might want be interested in playing with like
theme swapping or Lut examples:
