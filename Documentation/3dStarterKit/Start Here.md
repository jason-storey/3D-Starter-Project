# What is this?

This documentation explains settings and preferences for a unity project. The project is a 3D starter template with some basic personal preferences and prototyping tools I like. (The I being [[Jason Storey]]). 

# How do I use this? 

For the most part I intend to just write little blurbs whenever I think a specific decision might need context. 
I'll maintain an [[Index|Index file over here]]. 

# What If I have questions/what to contribute?

You can find me over on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JasonStorey) or you can reach me in my discord. 
Though to avoid bot spam there is a one time door charge of a few dollars. Plus the donations help with enough coffee to keep me awake enough to write this kind of nonsense.
